The twist was that we had to code this in the C language which I nor my teammates knew how to implement in the Mindstorms architecture. We ended up changing the operating system with ev3dev. The robot ended up being very successful however, the tracks we used ended up sliding quite a bit, so we had to add a function that added extra torque to the wheels to compensate for this.

For this project, we had to write contracts, make a plan and separate the work into multiple sections.  When it came to the actual robot, the goal was to make it deliver a book to a designated target then go from one point to another. The twist was that we had to code this in the C language which I nor my teammates knew how to implement in the Mindstorms architecture. We ended up changing the operating system with ev3dev. The robot ended up being very successful however, the tracks we used ended up sliding quite a bit, so we had to add a function that added extra torque to the wheels to compensate for this. The project was given full marks and has been highlighted to future students because of its unique function.\"\n  }\n}\n\nconst project = {\n  web: {\n\n  },\n  blockchain: {\n\n  },\n  router: {\n\n  }\n}",{"ruleId":"79","replacedBy":"80"},{"ruleId":"81","replacedBy":"82"},{"ruleId":"83","severity":1,"message":"84","line":48,"column":13,"nodeType":"85","endLine":48,"endColumn":81},{"ruleId":"83","severity":1,"message":"84","line":50,"column":13,"nodeType":"85","endLine":50,"endColumn":85},{"ruleId":"83","severity":1,"message":"84","line":52,"column":13,"nodeType":"85","endLine":52,"endColumn":74},{"ruleId":"83","severity":1,"message":"84","line":54,"column":13,"nodeType":"85","endLine":54,"endColumn":83},{"ruleId":"83","severity":1,"message":"84","line":56,"column":13,"nodeType":"85","endLine":56,"endColumn":80},{"ruleId":"86","severity":1,"message":"87","line":16,"column":27,"nodeType":"88","endLine":16,"endColumn":37},{"ruleId":"83","severity":1,"message":"84","line":18,"column":15,"nodeType":"85","endLine":18,"endColumn":232},{"ruleId":"83","severity":1,"message":"84","line":22,"column":13,"nodeType":"85","endLine":22,"endColumn":83},{"ruleId":"83","severity":1,"message":"84","line":25,"column":13,"nodeType":"85","endLine":25,"endColumn":81},{"ruleId":"83","severity":1,"message":"84","line":28,"column":13,"nodeType":"85","endLine":28,"endColumn":80},{"ruleId":"89","severity":1,"message":"90","line":3,"column":10,"nodeType":"91","messageId":"92","endLine":3,"endColumn":14},{"ruleId":"89","severity":1,"message":"93","line":224,"column":7,"nodeType":"91","messageId":"92","endLine":224,"endColumn":21},{"ruleId":"89","severity":1,"message":"94","line":268,"column":7,"nodeType":"91","messageId":"92","endLine":268,"endColumn":14},"no-native-reassign",["95"],"no-negated-in-lhs",["96"],"react/jsx-no-target-blank","Using target=\"_blank\" without rel=\"noreferrer\" is a security risk: see https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/links.html#link-type-noopener","JSXOpeningElement","react/no-direct-mutation-state","Do not mutate state directly.
