            <h4>The Very Very Begining</h4>
            <p><span>I was born on March 13, 2000 in the city of Helsingborg. Here I spent the first few years of my life.</span></p>
        </div>

        <div class="leftSide">
            <h4>Moving To America</h4>
            <p><span>When I was 12, my family decided to move to Marco Island, Florida, despite the fact that neither me nor my younger brothers could speak English. We ended up moving back and forth between Sweden and Florida, staying in the United States for a total of 2 years.</span></p>
        </div>

        <div class="rightSide">
            <h4>Settling Down</h4>
            <p><span>After turning 16 my family decided to settle for a while while me and my younger brother finished our studies at the International School of Helsingborg taking the International Baccalaureate program. There I studied Economics, English, and History at the higher levels, and Swedish, Chemistry, and Mathematics at the lower levels. I graduated in 2018.</span></p>
        </div>

        <div class="leftSide">
            <h4>The Big City</h4>
            <p><span>After graduating, I decided (without any experience) to move to London, England, to get a job at one of London's finer restaurants and advance to waiter. I got a job as a Commie de Rang a Wolfgang puck's resturant, Cut at 45 Park Lane, and after five months and hard work I got the waiter service.</span></p>

        <div class="rightSide">
            <h4>America 2.0</h4>
            <p><span>Eventually I had to move back to Sweden to finish some work to make me eligible for university in Sweden. Two months later I decided to move back to Florida with my brother to get experience in a different market. I moved in January and worked at one of the finer resturants in the area. The outbreak of COVID-19 two months later forced me move back to Sweden where I started studying programming for my university course.</span></p>
