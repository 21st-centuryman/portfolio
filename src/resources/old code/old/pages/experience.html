          <p>During the COVID-19 pandemic I decided to take online courses on how to make websites in order to start my own firm and work as a freelancer. During this period I worked at multiple resturants as it was difficult to find work. In July I founded RE-DO consulting AB, which is a firm that focuses on modernizing a company's image through design, be that logo design, advertising or web design.</p>

          <p>In January 2020 I moved back to Florida with my brother. I quickly got a job as a waiter at a high end fine dining resturant. This gave me the opportunity to mix both my personal approach from Nabo, and my professional service focused approach from CUT, giving the guests an experience like no other!</p>

          <p>During the holiday season I had to move back to Sweden for my studies. There I started working as a waiter in a local winebar, where I was responsible for orders and drinks. This was a much more casual enviorment which taught me the important of giving a great experience instead of only focusing on a fantastic service.</p>
