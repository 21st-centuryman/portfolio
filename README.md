## Note this will most likely be depreciated. 
I am currently working on redoing my website at the following repository [calexanderberg](https://github.com/calexanderberg/calexanderberg)

# Personal Portfolio
## Introduction
This is the code for my personal portfolio, a CV that I put online at:

https://www.calexanderberg.com

Check it out.

## What technologies were used?
Javascript, React, HTML, CSS, SASS

## What were the biggest challenges and what did you learn?
I had no idea how to create a website and am still revisiting the code so I would say almost everything was a challenge.

## What are your next step to improve it?
1. Implement the code in web assembly and rust using leptos. (A rust implementation of solid JS, to put it simply)
2. Add github actions to the project.
3. Implement tailwind css into the css styling. This is something that might be removed later.

## Please note:
Each improvement have their own branch.
